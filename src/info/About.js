        iRecord App is an application that enables you to get involved in
        biological recording. You can contribute your sightings with photos, GPS
        acquired coordinates, descriptions and other information, thus providing
        scientists with important new biodiversity information that contributes
        to nature conservation, planning, research and education.

        knowledge. It doesn&apos;t matter whether you are an amateur enthusiast or a
        qualified biologist, iRecord App is for anyone who wants to contribute
        to our database observations of the natural environment.
